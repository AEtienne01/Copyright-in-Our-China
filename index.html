<h1> Is Chinas Intellectual Properties good or bad ? <h1>
    
<body>
 China's Intellectual Property is not bad but its not being used right because there are many violators that dont really care what happens and because of that it made China be the Amercian "priorty watch list". Also the Chinese Gov. doesnt even have alot of copyright laws, but they made one to keep America happy.
